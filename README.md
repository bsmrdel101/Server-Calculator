# Server Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 day Sprint_

This is a calculator capable of doing basic adition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's called a server calculator because all of the math logic is done on a server, and sent back to the client. When using the calculator, it will show you the most recent answer, and the history of all of equations. You can click on any past equation in the history in order to repeat it again.
